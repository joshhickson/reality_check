# Reality Check - Multiplayer Mechanics

## Social Interaction Framework

Reality Check's multiplayer systems are designed to create authentic social dynamics that mirror real-world relationships - cooperation, competition, manipulation, and genuine connection all emerge naturally through gameplay.

## The MetaNet (In-Game Social Media)

### Core Concept
A simplified social media platform that exists within the game universe, allowing players to communicate, influence each other, and shape public perception.

### Communication Types

#### Public Posts
**Purpose:** Broadcast messages visible to all players
**Character Limit:** 280 characters (Twitter-style)
**Functions:**
- Seek help during crises
- Boast about successes
- Share life updates
- Manipulate public opinion
- Create social drama

**Example Posts:**
- "Just got promoted to senior analyst! Hard work pays off! üí∞ #blessed"
- "Anyone know a good lawyer? Asking for a friend... üòÖ"
- "Why do the worst people always seem to get ahead? #frustrated"

#### Direct Messages (DMs)
**Purpose:** Private communication between players
**Functions:**
- Negotiate secret deals
- Share sensitive information
- Make threats or promises
- Coordinate group actions
- Build personal relationships

**Example DMs:**
- "I saw what happened at the office party. Meet me after the game."
- "Want to split the cost of that investment opportunity?"
- "If you vote against me, I'll expose your tax situation."

#### Reaction System
**Available Reactions:** üëç ‚ù§Ô∏è üòÇ üò¢ üò° ü§î
**Strategic Uses:**
- Signal support or opposition
- Influence others' perception of posts
- Create social pressure
- Build or damage relationships

### MetaNet Algorithm
**Engagement Metrics:** Posts with more reactions get wider distribution
**Bias System:** Algorithm can be influenced by player wealth and connections
**Echo Chambers:** Similar-minded players see each other's content more often

## Real-Time Interaction Mechanics

### Turn-Based Communication
**During Active Player's Turn:**
- Other players can react to card draws and decisions
- Side conversations happen in real-time
- Pressure and influence attempts are encouraged

**Collective Decision Points:**
- Babel Events that require group consensus

- Community aid distribution during crises

### Influence Actions

**Competitive Sabotage:** Use information or resources to complicate others' situations

## Relationship Network System

### Dynamic Relationship Tracking
Each player-to-player relationship has hidden metrics:

#### Trust Level (0-10)
- Built through consistent virtue actions and mutual aid
- Damaged by betrayals, lies, or competitive actions
- Affects willingness to help and share information

#### Mutual Dependency (0-10)
- Created through financial arrangements, shared secrets, or emotional bonds
- Makes betrayal more costly but also more tempting
- Higher dependency creates stronger influence potential

#### Romantic Connection (0-10)
- Special relationship type with unique cards and interactions
- Can provide powerful benefits but also dramatic vulnerabilities
- Includes marriage, divorce, and affair mechanics

#### Professional Network (0-10)
- Career-based connections that provide business opportunities
- Can enable insider trading, job referrals, or industry information
- Affected by workplace ethics and competitive behavior
