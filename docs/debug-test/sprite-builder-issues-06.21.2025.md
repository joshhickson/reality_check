# Sprite Builder Debug Issues - June 21, 2025

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Debug Panel Not Displaying
- **Issue**: When clicking "Debug Sprites" button, no visible debug panel appears
- **Expected**: A floating debug panel should appear showing sprite loading status
- **Current Behavior**: Button click appears to do nothing visible to user
- **Code Location**: `public/sprite-builder.js` - `debugSprites()` function
- **Attempted Fixes**: 
  - Modified debug panel styling to use hypocycloid board designer pattern
  - Added floating panel with green terminal styling
  - Ensured proper z-index and positioning

### 2. Canvas Sizing Issues
- **Issue**: Canvas element was initially too wide (256x64) and overlapping other elements
- **Fix Applied**: Reduced canvas to 64x64 and improved centering
- **Status**: âœ… Resolved

### 3. LPC Sprite Loading Failures
- **Issue**: Multiple sprite paths failing to load from LPC generator
- **Error Examples**:
  - `/lpc-generator/spritesheets/torso/clothes/longsleeve/longsleeve/walk.png`
  - `/lpc-generator/spritesheets/legs/pants/child/walk.png`
  - `/lpc-generator/spritesheets/hair/ponytail/adult/walk.png`
- **Root Cause**: Path construction logic not properly handling LPC generator directory structure
- **Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress

### 4. Debug Panel Implementation Details
- **Problem**: Multiple attempts to create visible debug panel have failed
- **Approaches Tried**:
  1. Inline modal-style panel
  2. Floating terminal-style panel (similar to board designer)
  3. Various z-index and positioning strategies
- **Current Hypothesis**: Panel may be created but positioned off-screen or hidden by CSS

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions Needed:
1. **Debug Panel Visibility**: Investigate why debug panel is not appearing despite code execution
2. **LPC Path Resolution**: Fix sprite path construction to properly locate LPC generator assets
3. **Error Handling**: Improve feedback when sprite loading fails

### Investigation Areas:
- Check browser developer tools for JavaScript errors during debug panel creation
- Verify CSS conflicts that might be hiding the debug panel
- Test LPC generator directory structure and available sprite files
- Validate that `debugSprites()` function is actually being called

### Code References:
- Main sprite builder: `public/sprite-builder.js`
- Development page: `public/development.html`
- LPC generator: `lpc-generator/` directory structure
