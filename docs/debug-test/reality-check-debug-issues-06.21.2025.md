# Reality Check Debug Issues - June 21, 2025

## Overview
This document catalogs all known debug issues, errors, and technical debt in the Reality Check game project as of June 21, 2025.

## Critical Database Issues

### 1. Replit Database `.list()` Method Error
**Priority: CRITICAL**
**Status: Active**
**Error**: `TypeError: allKeys is not iterable`
**Location**: `server.js:501` in `/api/games` endpoint
**Description**: The Replit Database `.list()` method is not returning an iterable object, causing the games list endpoint to fail.
**Impact**: Players cannot see available games to join
**Stack Trace**:
```
Fetch games error: TypeError: allKeys is not iterable
    at /home/runner/workspace/server.js:501:23
    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)
```

### 2. Multiplayer Server Incomplete Implementation
**Priority: HIGH**
**Status**: Partially implemented
**Description**: While socket connections work, core multiplayer functionality is missing:
- Turn progression logic incomplete
- Game state synchronization broken
- Player reconnection handling missing
- Card resolution system not fully integrated

## Client-Side Issues

### 3. Three.js Deprecation Warnings
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Status**: Active
**Error**: Multiple instances of Three.js deprecation warnings
**Description**: Using deprecated Three.js build files
**Warning Message**:
```
Scripts "build/three.js" and "build/three.min.js" are deprecated with r150+, 
and will be removed with r160. Please use ES Modules or alternatives
```
**Impact**: Future compatibility issues, console spam
**Solution**: Migrate to ES Modules import for Three.js

### 4. LPC Sprite Loading Failures
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Status**: Active
**Description**: Multiple sprite assets failing to load from LPC generator
**Failed Assets**:
- `/lpc-generator/spritesheets/torso/clothes/longsleeve/longsleeve/walk.png`
- `/lpc-generator/spritesheets/legs/pants/child/walk.png`
- `/lpc-generator/spritesheets/legs/pants/teen/walk.png`
- `/lpc-generator/spritesheets/hair/ponytail/adult/walk.png`
- `/lpc-generator/spritesheets/torso/clothes/longsleeve/male/walk.png`

**Impact**: Character generation fails for certain sprite combinations

## Sprite Builder System Issues

### 5. Path Resolution Problems
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Status**: Documented in existing files
**Description**: LPC sprite path reconstruction has complex issues
**Files Affected**:
- `docs/debug-test/sprite-path-issue-analysis.md`
- `docs/debug-test/sprite-builder-issues-06.21.2025.md`
- `docs/debug-test/sprite-path-debugging-findings.md`

**Key Problems**:
- Inconsistent path structures in LPC generator data
- Missing sprite files for certain combinations
- Complex nested directory structures causing path mismatches

## Game Logic Issues

### 6. Turn Mechanics Not Fully Implemented
**Priority: HIGH**
**Status**: Incomplete
**Description**: Core turn-based gameplay loop is not working
**Missing Components**:
- Player turn validation
- Turn timeout handling
- Turn progression between players
- Game state persistence between turns

### 7. Card System Integration Incomplete
**Priority: HIGH**
**Status**: Partially implemented
**Description**: Card templates load correctly, but integration with game flow is broken
**Issues**:
- Card choice effects not properly applied
- Card triggers not fully implemented
- No validation for card conditions
- Card deck management incomplete

### 8. Board Interaction System Missing
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Status**: Not implemented
**Description**: Hypocycloid board renders correctly but has no player interaction
**Missing Features**:
- Click/touch handling for board movement
- Visual feedback for valid moves
- Player position tracking on board
- Ring trigger detection

## Performance Issues

### 9. Console Log Spam
**Priority: LOW**
**Status**: Active
**Description**: Excessive console logging affecting performance
**Sources**:
- Three.js deprecation warnings (repeated)
- Sprite loading failures (repeated)
- Debug messages not filtered for production

### 10. Sprite Canvas Performance
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Status**: Potential issue
**Description**: Sprite builder creates multiple canvas elements that may impact performance
**Concern**: Large sprite collections may impact mobile device performance

## Development Workflow Issues

### 11. Hot Reload Conflicts
**Priority: LOW**
**Status**: Intermittent
**Description**: Development server occasionally fails to properly reload changes
**Impact**: Requires manual refresh or restart

### 12. Asset Path Inconsistencies
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Status**: Active
**Description**: Inconsistent relative/absolute path usage across modules
**Examples**:
- LPC generator uses relative paths
- Main game uses absolute paths from root
- Mixed path styles in different components

## Security Considerations

### 13. Input Validation Missing
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Status**: Not implemented
**Description**: User inputs not properly validated on server side
**Risk Areas**:
- Game names
- Player usernames
- Card choice indices
- Socket event data

### 14. Rate Limiting Absent
**Priority: LOW**
**Status**: Not implemented
**Description**: No rate limiting on socket events or API endpoints
**Risk**: Potential DoS through rapid requests

## Documentation Gaps

### 15. API Documentation Missing
**Priority: LOW**
**Status**: Incomplete
**Description**: Socket events and REST endpoints lack proper documentation

### 16. Game Rules Implementation Mismatch
**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Status**: Active
**Description**: Documented game rules don't match current implementation
**Issue**: Design documents describe features not yet implemented

## Recommendations for Resolution

### Immediate (Critical Priority)
1. Fix Replit Database `.list()` issue - investigate alternative methods
2. Implement basic turn progression system
3. Complete card resolution integration

### Short Term (High Priority)
1. Migrate to ES Modules for Three.js
2. Audit and fix sprite path resolution
3. Implement player reconnection handling

### Medium Term (Medium Priority)
1. Add proper input validation
2. Fix sprite loading path issues
3. Implement board interaction system
4. Performance optimization for mobile

### Long Term (Low Priority)
1. Add comprehensive API documentation
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Clean up console logging
4. Optimize asset loading strategy

## Testing Strategy Needed

### Unit Tests Required
- Database operations
- Card system logic
- Game state management
- Sprite path resolution

### Integration Tests Required
- Socket communication
- Turn progression
- Multiplayer synchronization
- Character generation pipeline

### Performance Tests Required
- Sprite loading under various conditions
- Multiple concurrent players
- Mobile device compatibility
