# Reality Check - Stats System

## The Four Pillars of Life

Reality Check tracks four interconnected statistics that represent the core aspects of modern adult existence. These stats drive all game mechanics and create the foundation for strategic decision-making.

## Core Statistics

### 💰 Money (Financial Standing)
**Range:** $0 - $100,000+ (no upper limit)
**Starting Value:** $15,000 - $25,000 (randomized)

**What it Represents:**
- Liquid assets and spending power
- Economic security and freedom
- Ability to resist financial crises
- Access to higher-tier lifestyle choices

**How it Changes:**
- **Income Events:** Job promotions, investments, side hustles
- **Expense Events:** Bills, medical costs, lifestyle inflation
- **Sin/Virtue Choices:** Moral decisions often involve financial trade-offs
- **Babel Events:** Economic crises affect all players simultaneously

**Strategic Importance:**
- High money provides buffer against negative events
- Enables "buying out" of certain problems
- Required for some virtue choices (charity, helping others)
- Can corrupt moral decision-making at extreme levels

### 🧠 Mental Health (Psychological Wellbeing)
**Range:** 0-10 (0 = mental breakdown, 10 = optimal wellbeing)
**Starting Value:** 6-8 (randomly distributed)

**What it Represents:**
- Stress levels and burnout state
- Emotional stability and resilience
- Capacity for rational decision-making
- Overall life satisfaction

**How it Changes:**
- **Work-Life Balance:** Career success vs. personal time
- **Relationship Quality:** Strong connections boost, drama damages
- **Moral Alignment:** Acting against values causes stress
- **Health Events:** Physical problems affect mental state

**Special Mechanics:**
- **Low Mental Health (0-3):** Risk of impulsive decisions, auto-failing some cards
- **High Mental Health (8-10):** Bonus to resisting negative influences
- **Mental Breakdown (0):** Requires medical intervention, temporary stat penalties

**Strategic Importance:**
- Mental stability enables better long-term planning
- Low mental health creates vulnerability to exploitation
- Required for accessing certain personal growth opportunities

### ☠️ Sin (Moral Corruption)
**Range:** 0-20+ (no upper limit, but extreme values have consequences)
**Starting Value:** 0-2 (minor past indiscretions)

**What it Represents:**
- Selfish, harmful, or dishonest actions taken
- Corruption of moral compass over time
- Karmic debt that demands eventual reckoning
- Distance from authentic self and community

**How it Accumulates:**
- **Active Choices:** Accepting sin cards, exploiting others
- **Passive Complicity:** Ignoring others' suffering when able to help
- **Escalation:** Sin often leads to more sin to cover tracks
- **Social Pressure:** Group think and peer pressure

**Redemption Mechanics:**
- **Confession Cards:** Reduce sin through honest disclosure
- **Restitution Actions:** Make amends to those harmed
- **Self-Sacrifice:** Major virtue acts can offset previous sins
- **Time Decay:** Very minor sins fade over time without reinforcement

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Low-level sin can be strategically beneficial
- High sin creates vulnerability to blackmail and exposure
- Extreme sin (15+) triggers investigation events
- Sin affects final judgment and endgame scoring

### ✝️ Virtue (Moral Strength)
**Range:** 0-20+ (no upper limit)
**Starting Value:** 0-2 (small acts of kindness)

**What it Represents:**
- Self-sacrifice for others' benefit
- Acting on moral principles despite personal cost
- Building stronger community and relationships
- Authentic living aligned with values

**How it Accumulates:**
- **Sacrificial Choices:** Accepting virtue cards that cost money/time
- **Consistent Character:** Repeatedly choosing others over self
- **Difficult Forgiveness:** Pardoning those who have wronged you
- **Leadership in Crisis:** Organizing community response to problems

**Virtue Mechanics:**
- **Virtue Inspiration:** High virtue can inspire others to virtuous acts
- **Community Trust:** Virtue builds social capital and support networks
- **Crisis Leadership:** Virtue unlocks special roles during Babel Events
- **Mental Health Synergy:** Virtue acts often boost psychological wellbeing

**Strategic Balance:**
- Pure virtue can leave players vulnerable to exploitation
- Virtue without pragmatism can lead to financial ruin
- Moderate virtue provides social benefits without excessive sacrifice
- Extreme virtue (15+) can unlock special endgame paths

## Stat Interactions & Synergies

### Money ↔ Mental Health
**Positive Correlation:** Financial security reduces stress
- Below $5,000: -1 Mental Health per turn until resolved
- Above $50,000: +1 Mental Health bonus to stress resistance

**Negative Correlation:** Wealth can increase anxiety
- Rapid money gain: Temporary mental health volatility
- Fear of loss: High wealth players more vulnerable to market crash stress

### Sin ↔ Mental Health
**Cognitive Dissonance:** Acting against values creates psychological stress
- High sin + high virtue: Mental health penalties from internal conflict
- Consistent moral alignment: Stability bonuses regardless of direction

### Virtue ↔ Social Connections
**Community Building:** Virtue strengthens relationships
- High virtue enables group cooperation cards
- Virtue acts can inspire others, creating positive feedback loops

### Money ↔ Moral Choice Access
**Privilege Effects:** Wealth affects available moral choices
- High money unlocks expensive virtue options (major charity)
- Low money creates desperation that enables previously unthinkable sins
- Middle-class wealth provides most moral choice flexibility

## Dynamic Stat Relationships

### Stat Momentum
**Positive Feedback Loops:**
- Success breeds success: High stats enable choices that maintain high stats
- Downward spirals: Low stats limit options, making recovery difficult

**Negative Feedback Loops:**
- Extreme wealth can isolate and corrupt
- Extreme virtue can invite exploitation
- System includes rebalancing mechanisms to prevent runaway leaders

### Contextual Modifiers
**Global Events:** Babel Events can temporarily alter stat interactions
- Economic crisis: Money becomes more important, virtue less practical
- Social upheaval: Virtue becomes crucial, money less protective
- Health pandemic: Mental health interactions change dramatically

**Character Traits:** Personal modifiers affect stat scaling
- "Career Junkie": Money gains enhanced, mental health costs increased
- "Empath": Virtue gains enhanced, sin costs doubled
- "Survivor": Mental health more stable, money gains reduced

## Endgame Stat Evaluation

### Scoring Formula
```
Base Score = (Money/1000) + (Mental Health × 0.5) + Virtue - Sin

Bonus Multipliers:
- Balanced Life: +25% if no stat is extreme (>15 or <2)
- Authentic Living: +50% if actions align with stated values
- Community Impact: +Variable based on positive influence on others
```

### Judgment Categories
**Heaven (High Score + Positive Impact):**
- High virtue, low sin, positive community influence
- Balanced stats showing healthy life management

**Purgatory (Mixed Record):**
- Moderate virtue and sin, complex moral choices
- Gets to influence other players' final outcomes

**Hell (Negative Impact):**

### Alternative Victory Conditions
**The Saint:** Highest virtue score regardless of other stats
**The Survivor:** Highest mental health despite chaos
**The Builder:** Most positive influence on other players' outcomes
**The Hustler:** Highest money while maintaining social connections

## Advanced Stat Mechanics

### Hidden Stat Tracking
**Relationship Network:** Invisible stat tracking connections with other players
**Reputation:** How community views player based on past actions
**Karma:** Universal justice system that creates future consequences

### Stat Caps and Floors
**Natural Limits:** Some stats have practical limitations
- Mental Health: Cannot exceed 10 under normal circumstances
- Money: No upper limit, but extreme wealth creates new problems

**Protection Mechanisms:** Prevent total stat elimination
- Emergency financial assistance prevents money going below -$1,000
- Mental health interventions prevent permanent breakdown
- Community support can offset extreme social isolation
