### Scoring System
Points are calculated from final stats:
- **Money:** +1 point per $1,000 (max 20 points)
- **Mental Health:** +1 point per 2 stability units
- **Sin:** -1 point per Sin point (can be redeemed through specific actions)
- **Virtue:** +1 point per Virtue point, +2 for major sacrifices

### Bonus Points
- **Saintly Path:** +5 points if Sin < 3 AND Virtue > 8
- **Mental Fortitude:** +3 points if Mental Health stayed above 7 entire game
- **Purgatory Helper:** +2 points for assisting other players after death

### Final Judgment
Based on total scores and Sin/Virtue balance:
- **Heaven:** High virtue, low sin, positive impact on others
- **Purgatory:** Mixed moral record, gets to influence final outcomes
- **Hell:** High sin, low virtue, or destructive behavior

### Purgatory Voting
Players in Purgatory vote to boost or curse one living player, affecting final rankings.

## Winning Conditions

Multiple victory paths reflect different life philosophies:
- **The Saint:** Highest virtue with minimal sin
- **The Hustler:** Maximum money while staying morally neutral
- **The Survivor:** Highest mental health despite chaos
- **The Influencer:** Most positive impact on other players' outcomes

## Card Examples

### Sin Card Example: "Insider Trading Tip"
*Your college roommate works at the SEC and mentions a stock tip over drinks.*

**Accept:** +$5,000, +2 Sin, 10% chance of FBI investigation next turn
**Reject:** No effect, but roommate loses trust (-1 Social connection)

### Virtue Card Example: "Neighbor's Cancer Diagnosis"
*Your elderly neighbor is struggling with medical bills and asks for help.*

**Accept:** -$2,000, +2 Virtue, +1 Mental Health (helping others feels good)
**Reject:** No immediate effect, but neighborhood reputation suffers

### Chaos Card Example: "Social Media Algorithm Change"
*The platform you use for business changes its algorithm overnight.*

**All Players:** Roll dice to see if your income is affected by reduced visibility

## Strategy Tips

1. **Balance is Key:** Extreme stats in any direction create vulnerabilities
2. **Social Connections Matter:** Other players can help or hinder your progress
3. **Long-term Thinking:** Some cards have delayed effects that compound over time
4. **Moral Flexibility:** Pure virtue or sin strategies both have hidden costs
5. **Adaptability:** Global events can change optimal strategies mid-game

*Remember: Reality Check is designed to be both entertaining and thought-provoking. The real victory is the conversations and insights that emerge during play.*
