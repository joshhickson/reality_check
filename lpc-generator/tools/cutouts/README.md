LPC Sprite Character Cutouts
=============================================

This has blacked out "cutouts" for the arm positions! When using an image editor, add these to a separate layer and select all black on that layer, then choose a separate layer to delete.


Currently there's two variations:

1. "Arm Head Cutouts"

Head Cutouts are for cutting out the arms solely out of heads or faces. This "should" be global as these are (I believe) the same size for all postions.

Hair, Facial Hair, Eyes, and other Face assets may all fall under this category.


2. "Arm Body Cutouts"

Body Cutouts cut out assets that should appear in front of the body but behind the arms, like clothing. I find it unlikely that hairstyles should fall into this category, but its not impossible. These also cut out head/face assets as well as well, being an extension of the Arm Head Cutouts.

This should make clothing assets easier so you don't have to manually cut out these assets. So you can paste a "basic" clothing asset to all frames as long as the body position is the same, cut out the arms, then redraw the sleeve assets over the arms with corrected position. This also works for neck assets, too, such as necklaces or scarfs.

Only the portion of the arm "in front of" the body is considered, not the full arm in most cases.

Arm Body Cutouts are divided between male and female. Likely "Muscular" will also be added here but these assets are not yet complete.
