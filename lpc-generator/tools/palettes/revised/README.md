LPC Revised Palettes
=============================================

These are palettes used in ElizaWy's LPC Revised. Eliza's Heater Shield asset was ported over to ULPC reusing the same palettes, so it has been preserved here. However, we can also use these sheets if in the future we desire to generate versions of assets for LPC Revised as well.
