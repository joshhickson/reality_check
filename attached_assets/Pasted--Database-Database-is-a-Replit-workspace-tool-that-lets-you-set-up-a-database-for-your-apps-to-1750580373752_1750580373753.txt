# Database

> Database is a Replit workspace tool that lets you set up a database for your apps to store and query your data.

export const YouTubeEmbed = ({videoId, title = "YouTube video", startAt}) => {
  if (!videoId) {
    return null;
  }
  let url = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/" + videoId;
  if (startAt) {
    url = url + "?start=" + startAt;
  }
  return <Frame>
      <iframe src={url} title={title} allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowFullScreen></iframe>
    </Frame>;
};

Replit Database uses a fully-managed, serverless SQL database that lets you add persistent data storage to your Replit App
from the workspace. This serverless database implementation lets you pay only for what you use, making it ideal for projects
of any size.

<Info>
  Replit Database uses PostgresSQL 15 hosted on <a href="https://neon.tech" target="_blank">Neon</a>.

  2. Type "Database" to locate the tool and select it from the results.
</Accordion>

### Add a database

Use one of the following methods to add a Replit database integration to your Replit App:

* Ask **Agent** to add a PostgresSQL database to your Replit App, including details on what
  data your Replit App should store. Agent adds the integration, creates the database schema,
  and updates the app to communicate with the database.

* From the **Database** tool, select **Create a database**. When using this method, you
  must create the tables and update your app to connect to the database.

  </Frame>

### Run database commands

The SQL runner is a workspace tool that lets you run SQL commands on your database and view the results.

<Accordion title="How to access SQL runner">
  From the **Database** tool:

  1. Select the **My Data** tab
  2. Select <img class="icon-svg" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/databases/sql-runner-icon.svg" alt="SQL runner icon" /> **SQL runner**
</Accordion>

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/databases/sql-runner-run.png" alt="screenshot of the SQL runner and run button" />
</Frame>

### Browse and modify data visually

The Replit Database tool includes <a href="https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview" target="_blank">Drizzle Studio</a>,
a tool that lets you browse and modify data visually.

These visual tools help you avoid syntax errors and offer the following functionality:

* Filter and sort data to focus on specific information
* Export data to a file for external use
* Insert or modify row data
* Create and manage schema, tables, views, and enums

You can access these tools in the **My Data** tab in the **Database** tool.

The following image shows a view from the Drizzle Studio user interface:

</Frame>

<Tip>
  You can connect to your database using any PostgresSQL-compatible SQL client using the connection string
  found in your [environment variables](#environment-variables).
</Tip>

### View database connection credentials

When you add a database, the Database tool automatically saves your connection credentials
as environment variables in your Replit App. Your app uses the credentials to securely
connect to the database and run commands.

<Accordion title="How to access your database connection credentials">
  1. Navigate to the <img class="icon-svg" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/databases/postgres.svg" alt="PostgresSQL database icon" /> **Database** tool in your workspace
  2. Select the <img class="icon-svg" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/databases/angled-brackets.svg" alt="angled brackets icon" /> **Commands** tab and scroll to the **Environment variables** section
</Accordion>

The list includes the following environment variables, which you can reference from your Replit App's code:

* `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string which contains all details for a secure connection
* `PGHOST`: Database hostname
* `PGUSER`: Database username
* `PGPASSWORD`: Database password

To learn how to use these credentials in your code, see [Connect your app to a SQL database](/getting-started/quickstarts/database-connection/).

### Restore tool

The Restore tool lets you revert your database to a specific point in time.
To activate this tool, you must select a retention period in the **History Retention** option.
You can then restore from any point within that period.

Common uses for the Restore tool include the following:

* Recovering from accidental data deletion or corruption
* Reverting to a previous state for testing or debugging
* Reviewing historical data from a specific point in time

<Accordion title="How to access the Restore tool and History Retention setting">
  1. Navigate to the <img class="icon-svg" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/databases/postgres.svg" alt="PostgresSQL database icon" /> **Database** tool in your workspace
  2. Select the <img class="icon-svg" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/shared/settings-icon.svg" alt="gear icon" /> **Settings** tab and scroll to the **Restore** and **History Retention** sections
</Accordion>

To restore your database to a specific time, follow the steps below:

1. Enter the target date and time in the **Timestamp** field
2. Select **Restore**. Select **Continue** to proceed in the confirmation dialog.

### Remove tool

<Warning>
  The remove action is irreversible. Make sure to back up any important data before proceeding.
</Warning>

If you no longer need a database for your Replit App, you can remove it and all its data.

<Accordion title="How to remove a database">
  From the **Database** tool:

  1. Select the <img class="icon-svg" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/shared/settings-icon.svg" alt="gear icon" /> **Settings** tab
  2. Select **Remove database** and confirm by selecting **Yes, Remove Database**
</Accordion>

### Billing and resource usage

Replit optimizes your cost savings for database usage by using Neon, a serverless database provider.

Neon's serverless capabilities include the following:

* Zero infrastructure setup or maintenance
* Automatic scaling to handle your usage needs
* Compute time billing only when the database is active

The database enters an idle state after five minutes of inactivity, pausing compute time billing.
It instantly reactivates when it receives a query.

<Tip>
  To learn more about this serverless database technology, see the
  <a href="https://neon.tech/docs/introduction/compute-lifecycle" target="_blank">Neon Compute lifecycle</a> documentation.
</Tip>

Replit provides real-time tracking of your database usage.
You can view the breakdown of compute time and storage usage for the current Replit App
or for each Replit App on your account.

<Accordion title="How to access database usage">
  To view your database compute time and storage usage for the current billing period, follow the steps below:

  From the **Database** tool:

  1. Navigate to the <img class="icon-svg" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/databases/postgres.svg" alt="PostgresSQL database icon" /> **Database** tool in your workspace
  2. Select the <img class="icon-svg" src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/replit/images/shared/settings-icon.svg" alt="gear icon" /> **Settings** tab
  3. Scroll to the **Account resource usage** section to view a usage summary

  To view for every Replit App on your account from the **Account resource usage** section, follow the steps below:

  1. Select **View account resource limits** to open the **Usage** page
  2. Scroll to **Resource usage** section
  3. Expand the **PostgresSQL Storage** and **PostgresSQL Compute** rows for details on each Replit App
</Accordion>

### Security features

When you add a database integration using **Agent**, it adds an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)
that handles all  database communications with built-in security.

This ORM layer, combined with Agent's security best practice implementation, protects your app from
exploits through the following features:

* **Schema validation**: Verifies data conforms to expected formats
* **Data sanitization**: Automatically cleans up user input to prevent SQL injection attacks
